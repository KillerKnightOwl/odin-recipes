    <img src="/home/knightowl/Downloads/apple.jpeg">
    <p> <strong>APPLES!</strong> one of the easiest snacks you can eat at anytime. One of the most known quick snacks you can get, seen on every moive with a kid running out of the house chasing the bus down the street. Personally me my favorite one is the green, but sometimes I think the red is good but not the best.</p>
    <h4> Apple cutting steps</h4>
    <ol> 
        <li> Get a apple (which ever you choose)</li>
        <li> Put the apple of your choice down on a cutting bored</li>
        <li>Grab a knife and put it through the apple and place the knife in the apple 3 times different angles</li>
    </ol>
    <p> Then boom you have apple slices. You don't always have to cut it up but you can also eat it whole.</p>
